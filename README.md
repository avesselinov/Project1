# Restaurant Pricing and Consumer Perception DS4002 Data Divas Project 1
## Software and Platform section
We used Python to run the majority of our code either in Google Colab or in Rivanna. Platform varied by group member, so we used both Mac and Windows.In order to use Python in the most efficient manner, we used the following additional packages imported with this code: 
import nltk
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
from scipy import stats
